we wanted to see the true footprint
0:04
social gatherings like Spring Break
0:06
beach crowds could really have on our
0:08
society in the face of a global pandemic
0:10
to do so we started with the big picture
0:13
powering our engine with billions of
0:15
anonymized location data points from
0:17
mobile devices across the globe using
0:20
tectonics we can then zoom in on
0:22
specific regions here we focus
0:24
specifically on just one Beach in Fort
0:26
Lauderdale during the month of March
0:28
again each of these data points shown on
0:31
the map corresponds to a unique mobile
0:33
device active on a given day you can see
0:36
clearly the device activity spikes
0:38
during the two-week stretch of early to
0:40
mid March corresponding the Spring Break
0:42
no surprise now using an analysis called
0:45
a spider query we can actually track
0:47
movement of these devices over the
0:49
remaining weeks of March seeing where
0:51
these devices went after Spring Breakers
0:53
left the beach as we zoom further and
0:56
further out it becomes clear just how
0:58
massive the potential impact just one
1:00
single beach gathering can have
1:02
spreading this virus across our nation
1:05
it can be hard for us to realize
1:07
sometimes just how connected our world
1:09
really is until the data tells the
1:11
stories that we just can't see

i dont just wanna click the best worst and you but the other 10 below and 10 above also
make the gaussian chart of all data point keep best worst current and 10 above and below the chart clickable
